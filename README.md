OpenPlex automatically installs PlexConnect on your Mac, easily generates certificate files, updates, starts and stops PlexConnect without Mac terminal. OpenPlex is a open source app that will automatically properly install PlexConnect by cloning PlexConnect into ‘…/Applications/PlexConnect‘ on your Mac to enable easily updates, generate any desired certificate file (trailers, wsj, or iMovie), hi-jack desired Apple TV app (trailers, wsj, or iMovie), and update PlexConnect automatically or on demand. Furthermore, OpenPlex is running on up to Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite beta.
